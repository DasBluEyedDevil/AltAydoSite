Recruitment Aids



General Ad:



Aydo Intergalactic Corporation is an org primarily focused on the future of offering logistics services to other orgs as the appropriate gameplay loops are implemented into the game. While members typically dabble in various gameplay on offer in their free time, our focus is and will continue to be on logistics - more specifically, the movement of people and goods. While we are a casual org with no activity requirements, we do have options for more structured gameplay through ranks and training if one wants to participate in that.



Below is a run-down on who we are and what we offer:



:o: Predominantly NA and EU base of players 

:o: Mature Members (18+ is a requirement)

:o: New Player Friendly 

:o: Logistics Focus (cargo and personnel transport; industrial gameplay) 

:o: Casual (w/ voluntary rank & training path for those that want more serious/structured gameplay) 

:o: Many Affiliations with Other Orgs 

:o: Resident Racing Team (currently on a hiatus, but our racing manager is looking for people to jumpstart the team!)
