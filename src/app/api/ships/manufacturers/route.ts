 * GET /api/ships/manufacturers
 *
 * Returns all manufacturers with their ship counts, sorted alphabetically.
 * Used for filter dropdowns and manufacturer browsing in the UI.
 *
 * No authentication required -- ship data is public reference data.
 * No query parameters needed -- the full list is always small (~33 manufacturers).
 * No pagination needed -- manufacturer count is bounded by the FleetYards dataset.
 *
 * Response: { items: ManufacturerInfo[] }
 *   where ManufacturerInfo = { name, code, slug, shipCount }
