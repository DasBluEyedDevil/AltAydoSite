    content: `Based in the Ellis system on the planet Green, the Aydo Intergalactic Corporation (more commonly referred to as "AydoCorp") is an amalgamation of not only several companies within the system but also containing subsidiaries in a multitude of other systems. Aptly named due to its headquarters located in the city of Aydo, the corporation had its humble beginnings as a small one-man delivery company run by none other than the current CEO, Christoff Revan. Over the years the company would grow and expand, what was once known as "Aydo City Delivery" eventually became "Aydo Amalgamated Industries" after a merger with Seahorse Fisheries, based out of Neo Taurii on Kampos. After acquiring multiple subsidiaries and having greater expansions, the company would transform into the corporation we now know as "AydoCorp", serving many clients throughout human and alien space.`,
