# Dynamic Ship Database

## What This Is

AydoCorp's ship database is powered by the FleetYards.net API, with periodic sync into Cosmos DB/MongoDB. Ships are referenced by FleetYards UUID throughout the application and use FleetYards CDN images directly. The ship browsing UI provides multi-axis filtering, detailed specs, image galleries, and an org fleet composition dashboard. The fleet builder and mission planner use live API data with search and filtering.

## Core Value

The ship database is always current with the latest Star Citizen ships and data without any manual maintenance.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Static ship database with 500+ ships — existing
- ✓ Ship images served via CDN (images.aydocorp.space) — existing
- ✓ Ship selection in user fleet builder — existing
- ✓ Ship selection in mission planner — existing
- ✓ Ship data in resource management — existing
- ✓ Manufacturer-grouped ship browsing — existing
- ✓ Ship type/size/role filtering — existing
- ✓ Hybrid storage system (MongoDB + JSON fallback) — existing
- ✓ Periodic sync from FleetYards API into Cosmos DB/MongoDB — v1.0
- ✓ Ship data stored with FleetYards UUIDs as canonical identifiers — v1.0
- ✓ Ship images sourced from FleetYards CDN (multiple sizes/views) — v1.0
- ✓ Cron/scheduled job triggers sync automatically — v1.0
- ✓ Stale data used gracefully when FleetYards API is unavailable — v1.0
- ✓ Migration script converts existing ship name references to FleetYards UUIDs — v1.0
- ✓ All user profile ship references use FleetYards UUIDs — v1.0
- ✓ All mission/operation ship references use FleetYards UUIDs — v1.0
- ✓ Ship data API serves from database instead of static JSON — v1.0
- ✓ Fleet builder UI refreshed with better images and search/filters — v1.0
- ✓ Mission planner ship picker refreshed with improved UX — v1.0
- ✓ Old static ships.json and R2 image pipeline decommissioned — v1.0

### Active

(None — next milestone requirements to be defined via `/gsd:new-milestone`)

### Out of Scope

- In-game pricing / aUEC shop data — adds complexity, not needed for fleet management
- Pledge/real-money pricing — not relevant to org operations
- Ship loaner information — not needed for mission planning
- Mirroring images to R2 — using FleetYards CDN directly, simpler
- Manual admin sync button — cron handles it, can add later if needed
- 3D ship models / holo viewer — conflicts with MobiGlas 2D aesthetic
- Ship comparison tools — deferred to v2 requirements (CMP-01, CMP-02)
- Smart ship suggestions / fleet gap analysis — deferred to v2 (SMART-01, SMART-02, SMART-03)
- Loaner ship awareness / purchase locations — deferred to v2 (EXT-01, EXT-02, EXT-03)

## Context

Shipped v1.0 with 19,464 net new lines of TypeScript/React across 168 files.

**Tech stack:** Next.js 15.3.3, TypeScript, Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore, Tailwind CSS, Recharts.

**Current ship data flow:** FleetYards API → sync orchestrator (cron) → MongoDB `ships` collection → REST API (`/api/ships/*`) → React hooks (`useShips`, `useShipBatch`, `useOrgFleet`) → UI components.

**Ship modules:** `src/lib/ships/` (client, transform, sync, storage, image), `src/types/ship.ts` (ShipDocument, schemas).

**Key components:** ShipBrowsePage, FleetShipPickerModal, MissionShipPickerModal, FleetCompositionPage, ShipDetailPanel, ShipImageGallery.

**Build status:** 69/69 pages, 0 TypeScript errors, 0 ESLint errors.

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Next.js 15 / TypeScript / MongoDB (Cosmos DB) — must use existing stack
- **API dependency**: FleetYards API has no SLA — sync must be resilient to downtime
- **Data shape**: FleetYards response structure is fixed — our types adapt to theirs, not vice versa
- **Image dependency**: FleetYards CDN uptime required for ship images — CSS empty state fallback when missing
- **Migration**: All existing ship references migrated — 116/116 at 100% match rate

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Use FleetYards API as golden source | Eliminates manual ship list maintenance, always current | ✓ Good — 500+ ships synced, zero maintenance |
| FleetYards UUID as canonical ship identifier | Resilient to ship name changes, proper foreign key | ✓ Good — clean references across all collections |
| Periodic sync to database (not live API calls) | Fast page loads, resilience to API downtime | ✓ Good — 5-min cache, stale data preserved on API failure |
| FleetYards CDN images directly (no R2 mirror) | Simpler architecture, no image sync pipeline | ✓ Good — 4 view angles, multiple resolutions, zero maintenance |
| Big-bang migration for existing references | Clean cutover, no dual-format complexity | ✓ Good — 116/116 names matched (100%), idempotent |
| Cron job for sync (no manual trigger) | Automated, one less admin feature to build | ✓ Good — instrumentation.ts + overdue-check on startup |
| Zod .passthrough() for schema validation | Forward compatibility with FleetYards API changes | ✓ Good — API format change absorbed without breakage |
| 80% count-drop threshold for sync safety | Prevents data loss from partial API responses | ✓ Good — safety net in place |
| CSS-only empty states (no placeholder images) | Eliminates placeholder PNG dependency, cleaner fallback | ✓ Good — works consistently across all ship display contexts |
| useReducer for ship browse state | Centralized filter state, avoids stale closures | ✓ Good — clean state management in ShipBrowsePage |
