# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 05.1-01
    provides: "Manufacturer logo field in types, schemas, transform, and aggregation pipeline"
  - phase: 05-02
    provides: "ShipCard and ShipCardList base components"
  - phase: 05-04
    provides: "ShipDetailPanel base component"
  - phase: 05-03
    provides: "ShipFilterPanel with ManufacturerOption type"
  - phase: 01-01
    provides: "Ship data pipeline with format utilities"
provides:
  - "Ship cards (grid and list) display crew, cargo, and speed specs at a glance"
  - "Manufacturer logos render conditionally wherever manufacturer info appears"
  - "ManufacturerOption type aligned with API response including logo field"

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "Conditional Image render pattern: {field ? <Image .../> : null} for nullable URLs"
    - "Responsive spec columns: fixed-width right-aligned, hidden at smaller breakpoints"

key-files:
  created: []
  modified:
    - src/components/ships/ShipCard.tsx
    - src/components/ships/ShipCardList.tsx
    - src/components/ships/ShipDetailPanel.tsx
    - src/components/ships/ShipFilterPanel.tsx

key-decisions:
  - "Logo sizes: 16px grid cards, 14px list rows, 20px detail panel -- proportional to context"
  - "Spec separators in grid card use pipe with 0.2 opacity (subtle, secondary info)"
  - "List spec columns responsive: crew at md+, cargo/speed at lg+ to prevent overflow"
  - "ManufacturerOption logo field added for type correctness only -- native select cannot render images"

patterns-established:
  - "Conditional manufacturer logo: {ship.manufacturer.logo ? <Image .../> : null}"
  - "Format utility imports: import { formatCrew, formatCargo, formatSpeed } from '@/lib/ships/format'"

# Phase 5.1 Plan 02: Ship Card Specs and Manufacturer Logo UI Summary

**Manufacturer logos and crew/cargo/speed specs wired into all card and detail UI components, closing verification gaps UI-04 and UI-05**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-04T04:38:31Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-04T04:40:14Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments

- Ship cards (grid view) now show crew, cargo, and speed specs below the classification badge
- Ship cards (list view) now show crew, cargo, and speed as responsive additional columns
- Manufacturer logo renders as a small image next to manufacturer name/code in all 3 display contexts (grid card, list row, detail panel)
- When manufacturer logo is null (~76% of manufacturers), display gracefully degrades to text-only
- ManufacturerOption type updated for API alignment (logo field)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add specs and logo to ShipCard and ShipCardList** - `87a903c` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Add logo to ShipDetailPanel and ShipFilterPanel** - `04170cd` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/components/ships/ShipCard.tsx` - Added manufacturer logo (16px), crew/cargo/speed spec row with pipe separators
- `src/components/ships/ShipCardList.tsx` - Added manufacturer logo (14px), three responsive spec columns (crew/cargo/speed)
- `src/components/ships/ShipDetailPanel.tsx` - Added Image import, manufacturer logo (20px) before code badge
- `src/components/ships/ShipFilterPanel.tsx` - Added logo field to ManufacturerOption interface

## Decisions Made

- Logo sizes vary by context: 16px in grid cards, 14px in list rows, 20px in detail panel (proportional to surrounding content)
- Spec row in grid cards uses pipe separators at very low opacity (0.2) so specs are discoverable but secondary to ship name
- List view spec columns use fixed widths (w-12, w-16) and right-alignment for columnar consistency
- List view crew visible at md+ breakpoint, cargo and speed at lg+ to prevent horizontal overflow on smaller screens
- ManufacturerOption logo is type-only (no rendering in native `<select>`) -- a future custom dropdown could use it

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Both verification gaps (UI-04 and UI-05) are now closed
- Phase 5.1 is complete -- all ship browse gap closure work finished
- Ready to proceed with Phase 6 (Integration) or Phase 7 (Cleanup)
