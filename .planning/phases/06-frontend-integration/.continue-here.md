<current_state>
Phase 6 execution paused after completing Wave 2 (plans 02, 03, 04 in parallel).
Wave 3 (plan 05 only) has NOT been started. 4 of 5 plans are complete. No uncommitted changes.

The orchestrator was running /gsd:execute-phase 6 with wave-based execution:
- Wave 1 (06-01): Complete -- foundation hooks and mappers
- Wave 2 (06-02, 06-03, 06-04): Complete -- fleet builder, mission planner, profile/mission detail rewires
- Wave 3 (06-05): NOT STARTED -- org fleet composition dashboard with Recharts
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- Plan 06-01: Foundation hooks and mapping utilities (useShipBatch, useOrgFleet, mappers.ts, recharts install) -- Wave 1
- Plan 06-02: Fleet builder rewire (FleetShipPickerModal, UserFleetBuilder, UserFleetBuilderWrapper) -- Wave 2
- Plan 06-03: Mission planner rewire (MissionShipPickerModal, MissionPlannerForm) -- Wave 2
- Plan 06-04: Profile and mission detail rewire (ProfileShipCard, MissionParticipantShip, UserProfileContent, MissionDetail) -- Wave 2
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
- Plan 06-05: Org fleet composition dashboard (Wave 3) -- NOT STARTED
  - Task 1: Create FleetBreakdownChart (Recharts pie + bar) and FleetBreakdownTable (expandable drill-down)
  - Task 2: Create FleetCompositionPage, FleetCompositionTabs, and /dashboard/fleet-composition route
- After 06-05: Phase verification, roadmap/state/requirements update, offer next steps
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- [06-01]: ids.join(',') as useEffect dependency for stable array comparison
- [06-01]: Sequential chunk fetching (not parallel) to avoid API overwhelm
- [06-02]: FleetShipPickerModal uses pageSize 12, modal state resets on close
- [06-02]: UserProfilePanel also needed resolvedShips prop (Rule 3 auto-fix)
- [06-03]: Dense list rows in modal for efficient multi-selection scanning
- [06-03]: Replace "Est. Crew" with "Ships: N" (crew data needs static DB, now removed)
- [06-04]: Profile fleet is read-only, unresolved ships show text only (no placeholder images)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None -- all 4 completed plans passed type-check. Clean git state.

<context>
Execute-phase orchestrator was running with model_profile="quality" (executor=opus, verifier=sonnet).
After 06-05 completes, the orchestrator flow is:
1. Check for uncommitted orchestrator corrections (git status)
2. Spawn gsd-verifier to verify phase goal against codebase
3. Update ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, REQUIREMENTS.md
4. Commit phase completion docs
5. Offer next steps (Phase 7: Cleanup & Decommission)

Config: commit_docs=true, workflow.verifier=true, branching_strategy=none
</context>

<next_action>
Resume with `/gsd:execute-phase 6` -- it will detect 06-01 through 06-04 have SUMMARYs and skip to 06-05.
Or equivalently, the orchestrator can directly spawn gsd-executor for 06-05-PLAN.md, then run verification + phase completion.
