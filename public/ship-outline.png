<!-- 
This is a placeholder file. You should create a simple ship outline silhouette image 
and save it as "ship-outline.png" in the public directory.

The image should be approximately 96px Ã— 64px with a transparent background.
A simple blue/cyan silhouette of a spaceship would work well with the Mobiglass theme.

If you don't have this image, the dashboard will still work, but will show a broken image 
in the ship status widget.
