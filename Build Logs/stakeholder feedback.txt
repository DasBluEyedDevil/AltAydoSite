The goal is to provide actionable insights for an AI to understand and implement without disrupting the current aesthetic.

Main Menu
Mobiglas Aesthetic: Retain the "mobiglas" look and feel. The user highly values this aesthetic for its familiarity and in-game immersion.
Logo and Carousel Placement: Swap the positions of the logo and picture carousel. The logo should be placed at the top to reduce clutter.
Scanner Prominence: Reduce the visual prominence of the scanner on the main menu. While liked as a "fidget spinner," its current size gives a false impression of importance. It should occupy less than one-third of the menu space.

Services Page
Scanner Placement: Maintain the current placement of the scanner button on the services page. Its transformative effect on the page is appreciated here.
"Escort Services" Tab: Remove the "escort services" tab. This service does not align with the organization's core focus (transporting and managing cargo with self-provided protection, not offering protection services to others).

About Page
Leadership Ages: Remove ages from the leadership section. Replace them with handles, similar to the existing format for the user's handle.

Join Us Page
"Contact Recruitment" Button: Modify the "Contact Recruitment" button. Instead of directly linking to Discord, it should lead to an intermediary page.
New Recruitment Page Content: This new page should provide frank and direct information about the "IRL realities" of joining AydoCorp. 
This includes:
Emphasis on a casual yet structured environment for big events.
Information on training pathways and rewards for participation.
Clear statement on primary gameplay focus (cargo hauling, industrial gameplay).
The aim is to provide a "short, no-nonsense description" to manage expectations and avoid false impressions.

Contact Page
Suitability: The contact page is deemed suitable and requires no changes.

General UI/UX Improvements
Font Readability: Adjust font size or consider a font change to improve readability. Fonts are currently "hard to read at times." The change should be "slightly bigger" but not excessive.
Scrolling Performance: Investigate and address "laggy" page performance when scrolling too fast.
